Objective
The primary objective of the E-Commerce Customer Behaviour Analysis is to gain profound insights into the factors influencing customers' total spending on the platform. Through the exploration of diverse features such as membership type, customer ratings, geographic locations, and temporal patterns, the goal is to uncover key drivers that significantly impact customer spending behavior.
By employing advanced analytics techniques, the analysis aims to achieve the following objectives:
Identify Key Drivers
Determine the most influential factors that contribute to variations in total spending among customers. This involves a detailed examination of individual features such as membership type, average ratings, and geographic locations.
Segmentation Insights
Gain a nuanced understanding of customer segments based on demographics, location, and other attributes. This segmentation will provide a foundation for targeted marketing strategies and personalized approaches.
Formulate Actionable Strategies
Translate the insights into actionable business strategies. This includes developing targeted promotions, loyalty programs, and geographically tailored marketing initiatives to optimize customer engagement and increase overall spending.
Enhance Customer Satisfaction
Explore the correlation between customer satisfaction, as reflected in average ratings, and spending behavior. Identify areas for improvement and formulate strategies to enhance customer satisfaction, leading to increased spending.
Optimize Geographic Targeting
Leverage geographic insights to optimize marketing efforts. Tailor promotional campaigns and product recommendations based on regional preferences to maximize customer engagement and spending.
Encourage Repeat Purchases
Understand the impact of temporal factors, such as the days since the last purchase, on customer spending. Develop strategies to encourage regular purchases and implement retention initiatives for customers with longer intervals between transactions.
In the context of E-Commerce Customer Behaviour Analysis, SAS Enterprise Miner and Talend Data Preparation play distinct yet complementary roles.
